        <p class="info">
            I am a student at Rochester Institute of Technology working towards a Bachelor of Science in Software
            Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I have completed two years of my degree and currently I am
            interning with Amazon in Cambridge, Massachusetts as a Software Development Engineer. I enjoy coding and I
            have many small projects that you can view on the projects page of this website.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
            I acheived my Eagle Rank in July of 2015 after my senior year of high school. The Eagle Rank is the highest
            rank in Boy Scouts that is only achieved by about 5% of all Boy Scouts. Obtaining Eagle Rank also allows
            anyone who joins the military to have an E-2 rank instead of an E-1 that most people start at after boot
            camp. In 2015 I graduated from Liverpool High School, it was there that I found out I wanted to become a
            Software Engineer.

            Before my senior year of high school, I always wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer. My senior year I
            took an introductory programming class where I learned how to complete very basic programs to solve simple
            tasks in Java. It was this class that led me to switch my plans and pursue a degree in Software
            Engineering.

            To learn more about my experience in computing look at the Projects page of this website and to learn more
            about my skills in general, take a look at my resume through the link on the Resume page of this website. If
            you have any suggestions for my website or you have found any bugs, feel free to send me an email.
