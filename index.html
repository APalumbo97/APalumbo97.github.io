        <p class="info">
            I am a college student at Rochester Institute of Technology planning on graduating in May of 2020 with a
            Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering. I enjoy software development and I am currently working on some
            personal projects to demonstrate my development skills. I achieved my Eagle Rank in the summer of 2015. The
            Eagle Rank is the highest rank in Boy Scouts and is only achieved by about 5% of all Boy Scouts. I graduated
            from Liverpool High School in 2015 with an Advanced Regents Diploma with Honors and Mastery in Math and
            Science.
        </p>

            Before my senior year of high school, I always wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer. My senior year I
            took an introductory programming class where I learned how to complete very basic programs to solve simple
            tasks in Java. It was this class that caused me to switch my mind and pursue a degree in Software
            Engineering. Since coming to RIT I have taken many computing courses for my degree and have enjoyed all of
            them. They all involved a lot of work but the knowledge that was gained from each class is priceless.
            Currently, I have completed two semesters at RIT and achieved Dean's List both semesters.
        </p>
        <p class="info">
            To learn more
            about my experience in computing look at the Projects page of this website and to learn more about my
            skills in general, take a look at my resume through the link on the Resume page of this website.
