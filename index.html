        <p id="info">
            I am a college student at Rochester Institute of Technology planning on graduating in May of 2020 with a
            Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering. I enjoy software development and I am currently working on some
            personal projects to demonstrate my development skills. I achieved my Eagle Rank in the summer of 2015. The
            Eagle Rank is the highest rank in Boy Scouts and is only achieved by about 5% of all Boy Scouts. I graduated
            from Liverpool High School in 2015 with an Advanced Regents Diploma with Honors and Mastery in Math and
            Science. Before my senior year of high school, I always wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer. My senior year I
            took an introductory programming class where I learned how to complete very basic programs to solve simple
            tasks in Java. It was this class that caused me to switch my mind and pursue a degree in Software
            Engineering. Since coming to RIT I have taken many computing courses for my degree and have enjoyed all of
            them. They all involved a lot of work but the knowledge that was gained from each class is priceless.
            Currently, I have completed two semesters at RIT and achieved Dean's List both semesters. To learn more
            about my experience in computing look at the Projects page of this website and to learn more about my
            skills in general, take a look at my resume through the link on the Resume page of this website.
