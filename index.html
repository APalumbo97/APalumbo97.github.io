        <p class="info">
            I am a student at Rochester Institute of Technology working towards a Bachelor of Science in Software
            Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. Currently I am a sophomore with an expected graduation date of
             May 2020. I enjoy software development and I have many small projects that you can view on the projects
             page of this website. I acheived my Eagle Rank in July of 2015 after my senior year of high school. The
            Eagle Rank is the highest rank in Boy Scouts that is only achieved by about 5% of all Boy Scouts. Obtaining
            Eagle Rank also allows anyone who joins the military to have an E-2 rank instead of an E-1 that most people
            start at after boot camp. Finally, I graduated from Liverpool High School in May of 2015 with an Advanced
            Regents Diploma with Honors and Mastery in Math and Science. It was there that I found out I wanted to be a
            Software Engineer.

        <p class="info">
            Before my senior year of high school, I always wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer. My senior year I
            took an introductory programming class where I learned how to complete very basic programs to solve simple
            tasks in Java. It was this class that led me to switch my plans and pursue a degree in Software
            Engineering. Since coming to RIT I have taken many computing courses for my degree and have enjoyed all of
            them. They all involved a lot of work but the knowledge that was gained from each class is priceless.
            Currently, I have completed three semesters at RIT and achieved Dean's List two of those semesters.

            To learn more about my experience in computing look at the Projects page of this website and to learn more
            about my skills in general, take a look at my resume through the link on the Resume page of this website. If
            you have any suggestions for my website or you have found any bugs, feel free to send me an email.
