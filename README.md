#Anthony Palumbo

I created this website to show information about myself, including some personal
projects I have worked on.

This website is responsive and optimized for mobile usage, if you notice any bugs
feel free to send me an email so I can fix it.

The languages used are just basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, nothing crazy. If you
have any recent internet browser it should be able to handle this website.
