        <br/><br/>
        Project done for Computer Science 2 in Java. The project consisted of creating a GUI for a game that the
        professors created that included lasers and bank vaults that goblins stored their prized posessions in. There
        were two stages that were done with a partner. The first part of the project consisted of making a model for the
        game that operated with a plain text user interface(PTUI) and could be run on the command line. The second part
        was adding backtracking functionality and a graphical user interface(GUI) for the game. The GUI used JavaFX and
        followed the model-view-controller pattern. After the project was completed either the PTUI or GUI could be used
        depending on the program arguments when run.

        <br/><br/>This website is on my Github, it was created from scratch using just HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        Cool features include a navbar and a responsive design.

    <p class="projects">Health Monitoring System:<br/><br/>
        Project done for a software engineering class in C. The project simulated a primitive system that a hospital
        could use to monitor patient data including temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, and systolic and
        diastolic blood pressure. The program stored data in a circular buffer that held the ten most recent values
        inputed for a specific patient and information type. The project was coded in a text-editor and run on the
        command line.

    <p class="projects">HealthNet:<br/><br/>
        Web Application for a software engineering class. The project was completed using the framework Django and
        python. The application is used for hospitals to organize information about employees and patients and can
        store medical records for the patients. From the main page a patient or employee can login and view their
        account information and they are able to schedule appointments with doctors. On the accounts homepage there is
        a calendar that shows all appointments with either patients and doctors depending on who is logged it. Admins
        can view information for all users and can change things as necessary.
