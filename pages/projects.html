    <p class="projects">This website: <a class="githubLink" href="http://github.com/APalumbo97/APalumbo97.github.io">
        APalumbo97.github.io</a>
        <br/><br/>This website is on my Github, it was created from scratch using just HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        Cool features include a navbar and a responsive design.

    <p class="projects">Lasers GUI:<br/><img src="../images/lasers.jpg" alt="Lasers GUI" class="images"/><br/><br/>
        Project done for Computer Science 2 in Java. The project consisted of creating a GUI for a game that the
        professors created that included lasers and bank vaults that goblins stored their prized posessions in. There
        were two stages that were done with a partner. The first part of the project consisted of making a model for the
        game that operated with a plain text user interface(PTUI) and could be run on the command line. The second part
        was adding backtracking functionality and a graphical user interface(GUI) for the game. The GUI used JavaFX and
        followed the model-view-controller pattern. After the project was completed either the PTUI or GUI could be used
        depending on the program arguments when run.

    <p class="projects">Queen Problem Backtracker: <a class="githubLink"
        href="http://github.com/APalumbo97/Queens-Backtracker">Queens-Backtracker</a><br/><br/>
        <img src="../images/queenBacktracker.png" alt="Queens Backtracker" class="images"/><br/><br/>
        Java project that determines a configuration on a chess board such that n queens can fit on the board without
        being in danger of attacking each other. The program has the ability to use a command line interface or a
        graphical user interface with JavaFX. This project incorporates backtracking in Java.

    <p class="projects">HealthNet:<br/><img src="../images/healthnet.png" alt="HealthNet Calendar" class="images"/>
        <br/><br/>
        Web Application for a software engineering class. The project was completed using the framework Django and
        python. The application is used for hospitals to organize information about employees and patients and can
        store medical records for the patients. From the main page a patient or employee can login and view their
        account information and they are able to schedule appointments with doctors. On the accounts homepage there is
        a calendar that shows all appointments with either patients and doctors depending on who is logged it. Admins
        can view information for all users and can change things as necessary.

    <p class="projects">Tic-Tac-Toe Game: <a class="githubLink" href="http://github.com/APalumbo97/Tic-Tac-Toe">
        Tic-Tac-Toe</a><br/><br/><img src="../images/tic-tac-toe.png" alt="Tic-Tac-Toe Display" class="images"/>
        <br/><br/>A small personal project that uses C++ to play tic-tac-toe on the command line. When the game is
        started two players alternate taking turns by entering the coordinates of the square they would like to claim,
        the game ends when one player gets three squares in a line or there are no more possible moves resulting in a
        stalemate. The project uses only one class, the game board, to simulate the game. The code can be found on my
        GitHub page.

    <p class="projects">Bank Simulator: <a class="githubLink" href="http://github.com/APalumbo97/bankSimulator">
        bankSimulator</a><br/><br/><img src="../images/bankSimulator.png" alt="Bank Simulator Display" class="images"/>
        <br/><br/>A small personal project that uses C++ to simulate a bank storing accounts with interest
        compounded yearly. It features a command line interface where the user initially creates the name of the bank,
        then has the ability to add accounts, generate interest for them, delete accounts, display one account's
        information, or display all the banks information. Although this program is far from practical, it helped me
        learn about classes in C++ and substantially helped me understand how pointers work in C/C++. Clicking on the
        github link will allow you to view the code so you can download it, compile on your system and run the program.

    <p class="projects">String Sorter: <a class="githubLink" href="http://github.com/APalumbo97/C-String-Sort">
        C-String-Sort</a>
        <br/><br/>This project is simply one C file. It reads an input file and sorts all the words alphabetically
        regardless of case, upper and lower case strings are equivalent. The maximum number of strings is set to
        25000, so it can read fairly large text files, if you have a problem with it using too much memory try making
        that max value smaller.
    </p>
    <p class="projects">Health Monitoring System:<br/><br/>
        Project done for a software engineering class in C. The project simulated a primitive system that a hospital
        could use to monitor patient data including temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, and systolic and
        diastolic blood pressure. The program stored data in a circular buffer that held the ten most recent values
        inputed for a specific patient and information type. The project was coded in a text-editor and run on the
        command line.
